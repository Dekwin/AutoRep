# AutoRep
Course project. (Repair Shop)

This app helps technical specialists store information of repair shop activity.

This is my first work published on GitHub. 
The project was written on Java as an Android application.
In this work you can find some bad/hard code, however, I got a lot of experience of Android programming.
